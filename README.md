## what can it do? ##
- Extract RGBA images from a TGA file.
- Access embedded information such as file author, file comments, creation dates, and more!
- Create TGA images from thin air! *(note: actually requires a source image)*
- Edit extension information such as author, comments, job times, etc.
- Embed arbitrary information into a TGA file via developer entries.
- Read thumbnail images as well as generate them with bicubic interpolation.
- Basically everything you'd ever want to do with a TGA image (hopefully).

## what can't it do? ##
- give you up
- let you down
- turn around
- hurt you (todo: confirm this)

## looks great! how do I get started? ##
I'm glad you asked disembodied voice in my head. You can start by checking out one of our fabulous guides below (we worked really hard on them). If after reading all relevant information you are still confused about getting the library working for you, don't hesitate to open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/xNWP/xTGA/issues) or contact me directly via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThatNWP).
